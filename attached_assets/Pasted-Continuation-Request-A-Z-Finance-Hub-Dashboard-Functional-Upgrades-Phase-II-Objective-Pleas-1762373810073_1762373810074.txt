Continuation Request: A.Z Finance Hub — Dashboard & Functional Upgrades (Phase II)
Objective:

Please continue developing the current A.Z Finance Hub project while integrating the following new features and interface improvements.
Ensure all previous specifications remain active and consistent.

1. Authentication Upgrade

Add biometric login (fingerprint / Face ID) for mobile and tablet devices.

Keep the classic password option as a fallback method.

2. Dashboard Enhancements

Display “Total Cash Balance” for the full portfolio next to the total portfolio value.

Add “Available Cash per Platform” indicator (e.g., Sukuk, Manfa’a, Lendo).

Introduce more analytics widgets in the dashboard (e.g., ROI trends, average duration, distressed ratio, investment progress, etc.).

Maintain optimized UI (small icons, dark/light theme switch, responsive layout).

3. Professional & Lite Modes

Add a toggle option beside the language selector to switch between:

Pro Mode: Full detailed analytics, complete breakdowns, advanced charts, and full visibility.

Lite Mode: Simplified interface showing only main metrics (Total ROI, Total Capital, Active Opportunities, etc.).

This helps different user levels — investors who prefer simplicity vs. advanced users who need full control.

4. Settings Page (⚙️)

Add a dedicated Settings Page, accessible beside the language icon, including:

Font size control (increase/decrease text size).

Add new investment platforms (manual addition of new crowdfunding providers such as Sukuk, Manfa’a, etc.).

Theme and mode customization (Dark/Light, Pro/Lite).

Language toggle (Arabic / English Hybrid).

5. Investment Entry Improvements

When entering an investment amount, add a quick input button that increases in thousands (e.g., +1,000 SAR) instead of single riyals.

For each opportunity, display three key dates:

Start Date (Investment initiation)

Expected End Date (Planned maturity)

Actual End Date (when principal + profit returned)

Add a small box showing delay duration if applicable (in days or months).

Example: 30ي → 30 days delay, 2ش → 2 months delay.

Automatically flag any opportunity delayed 3+ months as “Distressed.”

6. Navigation Menu (Position Change)

Move the main navigation menu (currently on the left) to the right side of the screen,
for easier accessibility with the right hand on mobile devices.

7. Help & Guide Page

Add a Help / Instructions page that includes:

Overview of the app and its main features.

How to add new investments.

How to customize settings and dashboard.

Explanation of color indicators and key financial metrics.

This should be accessible from the main menu.

8. Stability & Testing (Replit Issue)

Currently, when testing “Add Opportunity” on Replit, an error message appears, the app crashes, and restarts automatically.

Please investigate and fix the crash loop during investment creation testing.

Ensure stable session handling and data save state between restarts.

9. Confirmation

✅ All previous dashboard KPIs, analytics, and visualization requests must remain intact (including ROI, status breakdowns, cash vs deployed capital, goal tracking, etc.).
✅ Apply all new additions without overwriting existing functionality.
✅ Ensure compatibility with mobile, iPad, and web versions as one unified ecosystem.

10. Optional Enhancements (Recommended)

If possible, please also include:

Animated feedback when switching between Pro/Lite or Dark/Light modes.

Ability to collapse dashboard sections to save space.

Persistent cache so dashboard data loads instantly after reopening the app.
